/**
First approach: bruteforce to get the pair 
- O(n ^ 2) for this
- Not suitable for the size of the input 

Pattern: need to find a pair of lines that create the best water inside.

Second: 2 pointers
- start with 2 pointers left & right with:
    left = 0;
    right = n - 1;
- repeat the process until left == right 
- calculate the volume based on the height and distance of left and right
                 v
[1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
 ^

                 v
[7,3,6,2,5,4,8,8,7]
^
 volume: 3 * 7 = 21
volume: 7 * 7 = 49
- how do we determine to move left or right for the next iteration?
    - left < right, which one to move?
        Move left for the better result
            - if the next left is larger, may yeild a larger result 

        Assume move right: 
            - if the next one is larger than right, still calculate based on left with shorter distance
            - if smaller than right, lost...

    - left == right, which one to move?
        - does not matter since it will always yeild a smaller Value
        - goes with left then.
